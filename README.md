Cerberus - Powerfull Malware Scanner

## Why?

I tried out clamav, it was a total resource hog. CPU usage of my server was around a 100%.

## What are you using?
 
 - The main DB of clamav
 - malwr.com 
   - hopefully latter on also VirusTotal
 - http://malshare.com/ signatures
 - virussign.com signatures
 - http://www.malwaredomainlist.com (for detection of malware IP-adresses)
 - Malwares from https://ytisf.github.io/theZoo/ for testign purposes
 
##The name
Cerberus is - usually - the three headed dog that guards the gates of the underworld

Cerberus(.sh - guardian) guards your pc(gates) that leads to the inside of your system(underworld - porn protector 5000 - lets be honest about that :D)
